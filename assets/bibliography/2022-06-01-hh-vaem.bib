  abstract={Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) have recently been highly successful at imputing
      and acquiring heterogeneous missing data. However, within this specific application domain, existing VAE methods are restricted by using only one layer of
      latent variables and strictly Gaussian posterior approximations. To address these
      limitations, we present HH-VAEM, a Hierarchical VAE model for mixed-type incomplete data that uses Hamiltonian Monte Carlo with automatic hyper-parameter
      tuning for improved approximate inference. Our experiments show that HH-VAEM
      outperforms existing baselines in the tasks of missing data imputation and supervised learning with missing features. Finally, we also present a sampling-based
      approach for efficiently computing the information gain when missing features are
      to be acquired with HH-VAEM. Our experiments show that this sampling-based
      approach is superior to alternatives based on Gaussian approximations.},
