I am a postdoctoral researcher at the <a href='https://www.compute.dtu.dk/english/research/research-sections/cogsys'>Section for Cognitive Systems</a>, in <a href='https://www.dtu.dk/english/'>Technical University of Denmark (DTU)</a>. I work within <a href='https://frellsen.org/'>Jes Frellsen's</a> group, where we embark on a range of fascinating projects. My primary research interests lie in Deep Generative Modelling, Bayesian Inference, and their applications.


<strong>Research</strong> 
&nbsp;
I am interested in the 
connection between Deep Learning and Probabilistic Modelling. My current research lies in creating more 
expressive generative models, increasing their robustness (e.g. dealing with mixed-type data or 
missing data) and developing better inference methods. My work has been applied to several fields, 
like Neuroscience or Psychiatry.

<strong>Previously</strong> 
&nbsp;
I completed my PhD in Probabilistic Machine Learning at <a href='https://www.uc3m.es/home'>Universidad Carlos III de Madrid (UC3M)</a>, where I was supervised by <a href='https://www.tsc.uc3m.es/~antonio/antonio_artes/Home.html'>Prof. Antonio Artés-Rodríguez</a> 
and 
  <a href='https://www.tsc.uc3m.es/~olmos/'>Dr. Pablo M. Olmos</a> 
from the 
  <a href='https://gts.tsc.uc3m.es/'>Signal Processing Group</a>. 
Previously, I was a research intern at the 
  <a href='http://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/'>Machine Learning Group</a>
in the 
  <a href='http://www.eng.cam.ac.uk/'>Department of the Engineering</a>,
  <a href='https://www.cam.ac.uk/'>University of Cambridge</a>
where I worked with
  <a href='https://jmhl.org/'>Prof. José Miguel Hernández-Lobato</a>.
I obtained two MSc degrees in Telecommunications Engineering and Signal Processing from 
  <a href='https://www.uc3m.es/home'>UC3M</a>, 
and my BSc degree in Telecommunications Engineering from 
  <a href='https://www.ugr.es/en'>Universidad de Granada (UGR)</a>.
