I am a final year PhD Student in Probabilistic Machine Learning at <a href='https://www.uc3m.es/home'>UC3M</a>. My supervisors are 
  <a href='https://www.tsc.uc3m.es/~antonio/antonio_artes/Home.html'>Prof. Antonio Artés-Rodríguez</a> 
and 
  <a href='https://www.tsc.uc3m.es/~olmos/'>Dr. Pablo M. Olmos</a> 
from the 
  <a href='https://gts.tsc.uc3m.es/'>Signal Processing Group</a>. 


<strong>Research</strong> 
&nbsp;
I am interested in the 
connection between Deep Learning and Probabilistic Modelling. My current research lies in creating more 
expressive generative models, increasing their robustness (e.g. dealing with mixed-type data or 
missing data) and developing better inference methods. My work has been applied to several fields, 
like Neuroscience or Psychiatry.

<strong>Previously</strong> 
&nbsp;
I was a research intern at the 
  <a href='http://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/'>Machine Learning Group</a>
in the 
  <a href='http://www.eng.cam.ac.uk/'>Department of the Engineering</a>,
  <a href='https://www.cam.ac.uk/'>University of Cambridge</a>
where I worked with
  <a href='https://jmhl.org/'>Dr. José Miguel Hernández-Lobato</a>.
I obtained two MSc degrees in Telecommunications Engineering and Signal Processing from 
  <a href='https://www.uc3m.es/home'>UC3M</a>, 
and my Bachelor degree in Telecommunications Engineering from 
  <a href='https://www.ugr.es/en'>UGR</a>.
