  abstract={
    Recent approaches build on implicit neural representations (INRs) to propose generative models over function spaces. 
    However, they are computationally intensive when dealing with inference tasks, such as missing data imputation, or 
    directly cannot tackle them. In this work, we propose a novel deep generative model, named VAMoH. VAMoH combines the 
    capabilities of modeling continuous functions using INRs and the inference capabilities of Variational Autoencoders 
    (VAEs). In addition, VAMoH relies on a normalizing flow to define the prior, and a mixture of hypernetworks to 
    parametrize the data log-likelihood. This gives VAMoH a high expressive capability and interpretability. Through 
    experiments on a diverse range of data types, such as images, voxels, and climate data, we show that VAMoH can 
    effectively learn rich distributions over continuous functions. Furthermore, it can perform inference-related tasks, 
    such as conditional super-resolution generation and in-painting, as well or better than previous approaches, while 
    being less computationally demanding.

  abstract={Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) have recently been highly successful at imputing
      and acquiring heterogeneous missing data. However, within this specific application domain, existing VAE methods are restricted by using only one layer of
      latent variables and strictly Gaussian posterior approximations. To address these
      limitations, we present HH-VAEM, a Hierarchical VAE model for mixed-type incomplete data that uses Hamiltonian Monte Carlo with automatic hyper-parameter
      tuning for improved approximate inference. Our experiments show that HH-VAEM
      outperforms existing baselines in the tasks of missing data imputation and supervised learning with missing features. Finally, we also present a sampling-based
      approach for efficiently computing the information gain when missing features are
      to be acquired with HH-VAEM. Our experiments show that this sampling-based
      approach is superior to alternatives based on Gaussian approximations.},

abstract = {We present a novel deep generative model based on non i.i.d. variational autoencoders that captures global dependencies among observations in a fully unsupervised fashion. In contrast to the recent semi-supervised alternatives for global modeling in deep generative models, our approach combines a mixture model in the local or data-dependent space and a global Gaussian latent variable, which lead us to obtain three particular insights. First, the induced latent global space captures interpretable disentangled representations with no user-defined regularization in the evidence lower bound (as in β-VAE and its generalizations). Second, we show that the model performs domain alignment to find correlations and interpolate between different databases. Finally, we study the ability of the global space to discriminate between groups of observations with non-trivial underlying structures, such as face images with shared attributes or defined sequences of digits images.},

  abstract={Depressed patients present with motor activity abnormalities, which can be easily recorded using actigraphy. 
      The extent to which actigraphically recorded motor activity may predict inpatient clinical course and hospital discharge 
      remains unknown. Participants were recruited from the acute psychiatric inpatient ward at Hospital Rey Juan Carlos 
      (Madrid, Spain). They wore miniature wrist wireless inertial sensors (actigraphs) throughout the admission. We modeled 
      activity levels against the normalized length of admission—‘Progress Towards Discharge’ (PTD)—using a Hierarchical 
      Generalized Linear Regression Model. The estimated date of hospital discharge based on early measures of motor activity 
      and the actual hospital discharge date were compared by a Hierarchical Gaussian Process model. Twenty-three depressed 
      patients (14 females, age: 50.17 ± 12.72 years) were recruited. Activity levels increased during the admission (mean 
      slope of the linear function: 0.12 ± 0.13). For n = 18 inpatients (78.26%) hospitalised for at least 7 days, the mean 
      error of Prediction of Hospital Discharge Date at day 7 was 0.231 ± 22.98 days (95% CI 14.222–14.684). These n = 18 
      patients were predicted to need, on average, 7 more days in hospital (for a total length of stay of 14 days) (PTD = 0.53).
      Motor activity increased during the admission in this sample of depressed patients and early patterns of actigraphically 
      recorded activity allowed for accurate prediction of hospital discharge date.}

  abstract={This paper presents a novel method for predicting suicidal ideation from electronic health records (EHR) and ecological momentary 
      assessment (EMA) data using deep sequential models. Both EHR longitudinal data and EMA question forms are defined by asynchronous, variable 
      length, randomly sampled data sequences. In our method, we model each of them with a recurrent neural network, and both sequences are aligned
      by concatenating the hidden state of each of them using temporal marks. Furthermore, we incorporate attention schemes to improve performance 
      in long sequences and time-independent pre-trained schemes to cope with very short sequences. Using a database of 1023 patients, our 
      experimental results show that the addition of EMA records boosts the system recall to predict the suicidal ideation diagnosis from 48.13% 
      obtained exclusively from EHR-based state-of-the-art methods to 67.78%. Additionally, our method provides interpretability through the 
      t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) representation of the latent space. Furthermore, the most relevant input features are 
      identified and interpreted medically.},

  abstract={A wide range of segmentation approaches assumes that intensity histograms extracted from magnetic resonance images (MRI) have a 
      distribution for each brain tissue that can be modeled by a Gaussian distribution or a mixture of them. Nevertheless, intensity histograms 
      of White Matter and Gray Matter are not symmetric and they exhibit heavy tails. In this work, we present a hidden Markov random field model 
      with expectation maximization (EM-HMRF) modeling the components using the α-stable distribution. The proposed model is a generalization of 
      the widely used EM-HMRF algorithm with Gaussian distributions. We test the α-stable EM-HMRF model in synthetic data and brain MRI data. 
      The proposed methodology presents two main advantages: Firstly, it is more robust to outliers. Secondly, we obtain similar results than 
      using Gaussian when the Gaussian assumption holds. This approach is able to model the spatial dependence between neighboring voxels in 
      tomographic brain MRI.}

  abstract={A MRI brain image segmentation method using a hidden Markov random fields with heavy-tailed alpha-stable distributions is presented. 
      Each brain tissue is modelled using an alpha-stable distribution. Then, a HMRF is used to include spatial information in the classification 
      model. The Gaussian distribution has been widely used for the modelization of the cerebrospinal fluid, white matter and gray matter. Nevertheless, 
      the alpha-stable distribution has been recently proposed as a more accurate alternative for this task. The alpha-stable distribution is more 
      impulsive and is also able to model the asymmetry and heavy-tails of the histogram of the brain tissues. We have tested the proposed methodology 
      in 18 MR images from the Internet Brain Segmentation Repository. The proposed methodology outperforms the segmentation results obtained when a 
      Gaussian model for the histogram of the brain tissues is considered. Furthermore, as the Normal distribution is a particulaar case of alpha-stable 
      distribution. Therefore, the proposed approach is also a generalization of the hidden Markov random field segmentation method with Gaussian 
      distributions.},
